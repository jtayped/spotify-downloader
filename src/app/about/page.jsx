          <p>
            This website allows users to download Spotify playlists and tracks
            easily. When downloading playlist the website returns a ZIP file
            with all the tracks. Individual tracks are served with metadata.
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">How do I use it?</h2>
          <p>
            Simply press on the three dots in a Spotify track or playlist, share
            it, copy the link, then paste the link in the input dialog on the{" "}
            <Link href="" className="underline">
              home page
            </Link>
            .
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">How does it work?</h2>
          <p>
            The website uses the Spotify API to get data from playlists and
            tracks. When downloading them it uses <i>youtube-sr</i> to find the
            best match to the track, then it uses <i>ytdl-core</i> to download
            the match, and serves it to the user in the appropriate format.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tracks with metadata are converted to MP3 using <i>ffmpeg.wasm</i>{" "}
            and decorated with the data from the Spotify API (title, album,
            cover, artists). At the moment, only individual tracks are served
            with metadata, and will be fixed in the near future. This is due to
            the long time hole playlists take to process.
